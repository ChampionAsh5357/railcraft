  files or their contents from Railcraft Reborn in your Railcraft Reborn Texture Pack as long as you
  provide attribution and a link to the [Railcraft Blog](https://railcraft.info/).

* You may create, publish, and earn revenue from an addon made for Railcraft Reborn using the
  Railcraft Reborn API (addon being defined as a mini-mod that requires Railcraft Reborn be

  desired. However, no addon code will be ever be included in Railcraft Reborn without the addon
  makers permission.

## Public Mod Packs

* This section pertains **ONLY** to publicly available mod packs. The section does not apply to
  Private Server Packs as defined previously in the Usage Section.

    * You are **REQUIRED** to **PUBLICLY** post a licensing page with entries for all the mods
      currently in your mod pack (links to licenses, images of PMs, posts by devs, etc...). This is
      the single most important requirement you must meet. If you cannot or will not do this, you
      cannot use Railcraft Reborn in your mod pack.
    * You may not sell the mod pack.
    * You are not allowed to use the latest series of Railcraft Reborn (versioning system being <
      major.series.revision.build>, ie 3.3.1.0) until a new series is released or one week has
      passed since the last revision was released. This is to protect the users from unstable
      versions.

    * [Railcraft Wiki](https://railcraft.info/wiki) and
      [Railcraft License](https://railcraft.info/wiki/info:license) on your website.
