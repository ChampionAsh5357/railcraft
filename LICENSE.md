## Usage

* The "*.toml" files in the config folder are not considered part of Railcraft Reborn and may be

        * If you wish to create a **public** client bundle including Railcraft Reborn for your
          users, you must follow the Public Mod Pack Restrictions below.
        * **Private client bundles are permitted without requiring that you meet the restrictions on

## Derivatives

* You may create, publish, and earn revenue from a texture pack made for Railcraft Reborn so long as
  it contains no Railcraft Reborn code. Additionally, you may use, modify, and distribute any png
  files or their contents from Railcraft Reborn in your Railcraft Reborn Texture Pack as long as you
  provide attribution and a link to the
  [Railcraft Reborn GitHub](https://github.com/railcraft-reborn/railcraft).

* You can create, publish, and earn revenue from an add-on built for Railcraft Reborn using the
  Railcraft Reborn API (add-on is defined as a mini-mod that requires Railcraft Reborn to be 
  installed to work), though Sm0keySa1m0n and 3divad99 reserve the right to implement similar 
  functionality if desired. However, no addon code will ever be included in Railcraft Reborn 
  without the permission of the addon makers.

* You may create, publish, and earn revenue from videos that display all or part of Railcraft
  Reborn.

* You may create, publish, and earn revenue from maps that require Railcraft Reborn. You may

  below. If you require your users to install Railcraft Reborn, provide a link to
  the [Railcraft Reborn GitHub](https://github.com/railcraft-reborn/railcraft).

  another site without the express permission of the authors. And if you have permission you 
  must include a link to the
