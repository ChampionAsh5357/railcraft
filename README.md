## What is Railcraft Reborn?

Railcraft Reborn is a community driven continuation of the popular Minecraft mod
[Railcraft](https://github.com/Railcraft/Railcraft), originally developed by **CovertJaguar**.
It is built on top of the [NeoForged](https://github.com/neoforged) API.

The mod greatly expands and improves the minecart system in Minecraft - adding many new blocks,
entities, and features.

This project is maintained by:

- [**Edivad99**](https://github.com/Edivad99)

Thanks also to [LetterN](https://github.com/LetterN) who contributed in the early stages
