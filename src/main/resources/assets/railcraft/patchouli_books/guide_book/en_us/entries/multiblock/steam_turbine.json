We offer to you the mighty Steam Turbine, a device capable of turning Steam into Electrical Power.$(br2)It's built in a 2x3x2 pattern, the same as the Crusher. Additionally it requires that a Turbine Rotor is installed to operate. A Rotor should last for several days of constant use (real-time). You can then repair the rotor by combining two rotors using the vanilla repair mechanic."
