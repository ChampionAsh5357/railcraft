If broken down, it takes 104 Clay and 130 Sand to build one Coke Oven. They cannot be built adjacent to each other, there must be at least one tile in between ovens."

The filled Buckets will not stack. The filled Bottles will.$(br2)Converting Coal into Coke is a slow process. You will probably want to build several Ovens if you plan to make a lot rails."
