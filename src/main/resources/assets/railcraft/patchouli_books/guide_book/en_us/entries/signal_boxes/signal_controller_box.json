Multiple Controller Boxes can be placed next to a single Receiver Box. This enables a single Block Signal to control multiple Switch Motors or Distant Signals.$(br2)Placing two Receiver Boxes next to a Controller Box will cause the Controller Box to send the most restrictive Signal Aspect between the two.

It will however always emit the most restrictive Aspect between the one chosen in the GUI and one received from a Receiver Box. You cannot link a controller to two receivers. Placing a receiver next to a controller will make the receiver give information to the controller but will not actually link them together."
